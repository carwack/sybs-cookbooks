# ðŸŽ‰ Introduction

So it seems like the README.md is the index file of a new part. But wait using index.md looks better and works too!

This book contains stuff about VuePress itself. ðŸŽ‰

## Using VuePress
Ofcourse there is some official documentation found [here](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/).
And well more good information in this free open source book [vuepressbook](https://vuepressbook.com/) by **Tom Campbell**.

## Start new VuePress
If you want to get started with a new VuePress project use the following command for using the [vuepress site generator](https://github.com/vuepressjs/create-vuepress-site/).

```bash
yarn create vuepress-site [optionalDirectoryName]
```

## Run VuePress
You know somehow we need to be inside the docs folder what is the main folder here.
Now let's run it with the following yarn command, it's not that hard. ðŸ˜…

```bash
cd docs
yarn dev
```
